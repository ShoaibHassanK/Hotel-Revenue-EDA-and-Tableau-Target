# Hotel-Revenue-EDA-and-Tableau-Target
This repository showcases my data exploration and EDA skills using hotel booking data. The project involved consolidating and cleaning data from multiple years and designing a target table for Tableau analysis. I acted as an ETL specialist, ensuring the data was well-prepared for analytical insights.

# Hotel Revenue EDA and Tableau Target

As a data analyst, I undertook a project focused on hotel revenue trends. With a dataset spanning multiple years, I conducted data exploration and cleaning, preparing the data for deeper analysis and visualization in Tableau. Here are the key highlights of my work:

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning:** I consolidated data from different years and cleaned it for analysis.

- **SQL Functions:** I employed various SQL functions like `SUM`, `ROUND`, and `JOIN` for data manipulation.

- **Tableau Target Design:** I structured the data into a target table suitable for Tableau visualization.
